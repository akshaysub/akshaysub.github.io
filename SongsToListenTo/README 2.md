# Bitcamp-1
Project from my first hackathon

Uses HTML and JavaScript as well as CSS to create a website. The website is used to create a list of songs the user wants to listen to later, when they wan't to write down a song that they can not listen to at the moment. Utilizes buttons and listeners in JavaScript and was designed using HTML and CSS.
