	<p>I am currently a sophomore student at the University of Maryland pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science and minoring in innovation and entrepreneurship. I am involved in various student organizations on campus. For example, I am a member of a professional, co-ed, technology fraternity called Kappa Theta Pi. In addition, I am a peer mentor for the College Park Scholars - Science and Global Change program. In the future, I want to use my technological skills combined with my entrepreneurship knowledge to innovate and create technological solutions to real world problems. I also hope to help the environment and reduce plastic pollution, whether it is in my career or separate. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing basketball, listening to music, and spending time with my friends and family.</p>
